# CustomerAcquisitionCostPrediction
Predicting the cost of acquiring new customers using data analytics, EDA and machine learning techniques on  ```media_prediction.csv``` dataset

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze and understand Customer Acquisition Cost, a critical metric for businesses. We aim to help you make data-driven decisions to improve your marketing strategies and overall business performance.

## Understanding the Data
We'll be using a dataset called ```media_prediction.csv``` to perform our analysis. This dataset includes various columns related to sales, costs, demographics, and more.
The dataset contains 40 columns and doesn't have any missing values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We start by performing an EDA to gain insights into the data. Some of the key points covered include:

* Correlation analysis to understand relationships between various features.
* Frequency histograms to visualize the distribution of costs.
* Categorical data analysis, including visualizations and insights.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building a model, we preprocess the data, which includes encoding categorical variables using the OneHotEncoder. We split the data into training and testing sets, paving the way for model development.

## Model Building

In this project, we use a decision tree regressor to analyze and predict Customer Acquisition Cost. We utilize a Pipeline to streamline the data preprocessing and model training. The model demonstrates strong performance on both the training and testing datasets.

The model performs exceptionally well on the testing dataset, with high accuracy scores.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of Customer Acquisition Cost, empowering businesses to make informed decisions. By understanding the relationships between various factors and building predictive models, you can optimize your marketing strategies and improve ROI.
